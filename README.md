Introduction
---

I solve Project Euler problems to practice and extend my math and programming skills, all while having fun at the same
time.
Here I make my solutions publicly available for other enthusiasts to learn from and to critique.
This page lists all of my Project Euler solution code.

Each problem that I solved always includes a Python program.
All my code is original work, not based on anyone elseâ€™s code, although a couple of times I obtained the high-level
approach from reading various literature on the web.


What is Project Euler?
---

[Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net)](https://projecteuler.net/) is
a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems
that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods,
the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve
most problems.
